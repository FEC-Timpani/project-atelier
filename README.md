# Timpani Trading Co.
A modular, client-facing retail portal comprised of Product Overview, Related Products, Question & Answer, and Review widgets.

# Description
This is a application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using REACT state and Express server which makes API calls to the Heroku FEC API. The application loads products and displays them, allowing the user to see a product, related products, questions & answers about the product, and reviews on the product. Users can navigate to related product pages by clicking on any product to get more information including pricing, q&a, and reviews and rating. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart. The API stores user activity including the element clicked and items added to the shopping cart.

# Installation

  * npm start to start server

# Usage
